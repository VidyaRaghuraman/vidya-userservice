# vidya-userservice
Draft project with my first tests for User Service API

User service REST API is used for user authetication in Your.MD. This service is designed to send and receive JSON format data.
This is one of the critical services which is solely relied upon for user login to any App.

To be able to run the project, modify the env.properties file with the correct "HOST" data, this changes every day. 
At later point a static url can be used which requires some modifications to the tests. 

The tests are created by asserting every response and also by passing a response data from one test to another.
